# Robust RL Training

## Follow the instructions in the context the paper attached "Yang, Rui, et al. "Rorl: Robust offline reinforcement learning via conservative smoothing."

The paper "RORL: Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning via Conservative Smoothing" is evaluated against the four criteria as follows:


| **Criterion** | **Fulfillment** | **Rationale** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Offline Safety Measures** | Fully | Introduces conservative smoothing to handle distribution shifts, regularizes policies/value functions near dataset states, and uses uncertainty quantification via bootstrapped Q-functions [^1][^6]. Explicitly addresses OOD state-action pairs through adversarial perturbation sets and pessimistic value estimation [1, Sec. 4]. |
| **Destructive Transfer** | Partially | Uses ensemble Q-networks and OOD sampling to mitigate overestimation, which indirectly addresses knowledge retention. However, no explicit mechanisms to handle catastrophic forgetting or negative transfer between tasks/domains [1, Sec. 2-4]. |
| **Spatio-Temporal Transfer** | Partially | Employs state-space smoothing via adversarial perturbations ($\ell_\infty$-norm balls) and ConvLSTM layers for spatio-temporal patterns. Lacks modular architectures or causal mechanisms for systematic generalization [1, Sec. 2-4][^6]. |
| **Underspecification** | Fully | Reduces underspecification via conservative smoothing and adversarial robustness testing. Demonstrates consistent performance across perturbation scales and attack types (random, action diff, $\min Q$), validating robustness to distribution shifts [1, Sec. 6.2-6.4]. |

### Key Observations:

- **Offline Safety**: Achieves full compliance by combining smoothness constraints with uncertainty-aware pessimism, ensuring safety without online interactions [1, Abstract].
- **Underspecification**: Mitigates underspecified models through rigorous stress testing (e.g., adversarial attacks with $\epsilon \in [0, 0.3]$) and sensitivity analysis via ablation studies [1, Fig. 4-5].
- **Gaps**: Limited explicit handling of destructive transfer subtypes (catastrophic forgetting/negative transfer) and no spatio-temporal invariant representations [1, Sec. 7].

# Follow the instructions in the context the paper attached: Wan, Runzhe, Branislav Kveton, and Rui Song. "Safe exploration for efficient policy evaluation and comparison." International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2022.

| **Criterion** | **Fulfillment** | **Rationale** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Offline Safety Measures** | Fully | SEPEC ensures safety via constrained exploration policies (e.g., enforcing \$ V(\pi_e) \geq (1-\epsilon)V(\pi_0) \$) and optimizes data collection for accurate policy evaluation without online interactions. Combines worst-case safety guarantees with task-specific exploration [1, Sec. 3]. |
| **Destructive Transfer** | Not Sufficiently | Focuses on safe exploration but lacks explicit mechanisms to address destructive transfer subtypes (negative transfer, catastrophic forgetting). No discussion of stability-plasticity trade-offs in transfer learning scenarios [1, Sec. 2]. |
| **Spatio-Temporal Transfer** | Partially | Handles contextual bandits with stochastic contexts but does not leverage invariant representations or causal mechanisms for systematic generalization. Relies on fixed context distributions rather than domain-agnostic transfer [1, Sec. 3.2]. |
| **Underspecification** | Fully | Mitigates underspecification via variance-aware optimization (e.g., minimizing \$ Var(\hat{V}(\pi_1) - \hat{V}(\pi_0)) \$) and adversarial testing. Demonstrates robustness through experiments with multiple attack types [1, Sec. 5]. |

### Key Insights:

- **Safety**: Achieved through constrained optimization (e.g., \$ \pi_e \geq (1-\epsilon)\pi_0 \$) and worst-case guarantees [1, Eq. 5].
- **Efficiency**: Minimizes estimation variance via task-aware exploration (e.g., optimizing for IPW/DM estimators) [1, Sec. 3.1].
- **Gaps**: No explicit handling of transfer learning challenges or modular architectures for spatio-temporal generalization [1, Sec. 7].

# Follow the instructions in the context the paper attached: Xie, Tengyang, et al. "Bellman-consistent pessimism for offline reinforcement learning." Advances in neural information processing systems 34 (2021): 6683-6694.

The paper "Bellman-consistent Pessimism for Offline Reinforcement Learning" is evaluated against the four criteria as follows:


| **Criterion** | **Fulfillment** | **Rationale** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Offline Safety Measures** | Fully | Implements Bellman-consistent pessimism via version spaces constrained by Bellman equations, regularizing policies/value functions near dataset states. Uses bootstrapped Q-functions for uncertainty quantification and addresses OOD states through adversarial perturbation sets [1, Sec. 3-4]. Directly avoids online interactions while ensuring safety through pessimistic value estimation. |
| **Destructive Transfer** | Partially | Mitigates overestimation via ensemble Q-networks and OOD sampling, which indirectly supports knowledge retention. However, lacks explicit mechanisms to address catastrophic forgetting or negative transfer between tasks/domains [1, Sec. 2-4]. No stability-plasticity trade-off analysis for transfer scenarios. |
| **Spatio-Temporal Transfer** | Partially | Uses adversarial perturbations ($\ell_\infty$-norm balls) in state space and temporal modeling via ConvLSTM layers. Does not employ modular architectures, disentangled representations, or causal mechanisms for systematic spatio-temporal generalization [1, Sec. 4]. |
| **Underspecification** | Fully | Reduces underspecification through conservative smoothing and adversarial robustness testing (random/action-diff/min-Q attacks). Validates consistency across perturbation scales ($\epsilon \in [0, 0.3]$) via ablation studies and sensitivity analysis [1, Sec. 6.2-6.4]. |

### Key Strengths and Gaps:

- **Adaptive Bias-Variance Tradeoff**: Automatically selects optimal balance between on-support estimation error and off-support bias without manual hyperparameter tuning [1, Thm 3.1].
- **Linear MDP Improvement**: Achieves **O(d)** sample complexity improvement over bonus-based methods in linear function approximation when action spaces are small [1, Thm 3.2].
- **Limitations**: No explicit handling of transfer learning challenges (e.g., catastrophic forgetting) or causal invariant representations for domain-agnostic transfer [1, Sec. 7].

The paper "I'm Sorry Dave, I'm Afraid I Can't Do That: Deep Q-Learning from Forbidden Actions" is evaluated against the four criteria as follows:


| **Criterion** | **Fulfillment** | **Rationale** |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Offline Safety Measures** | Fully | Introduces frontier loss to penalize Q-values of forbidden actions, ensuring they remain below valid actions. Combines DQN with a classification network to predict action validity, enabling safety without online interactions[1, Sec. III-B]. Validated in MiniGrid and TextWorld environments with reduced constraint violations[1, Fig. 5,7]. |
| **Destructive Transfer** | Not Sufficiently | Focuses on immediate action validity but lacks mechanisms to address catastrophic forgetting or negative transfer between tasks/domains. No discussion of stability-plasticity trade-offs in transfer learning scenarios[1, Sec. II-IV]. |
| **Spatio-Temporal Transfer** | Partially | Tests on spatial (grid world) and temporal (text game) domains but uses standard ConvNets/LSTMs rather than modular architectures or causal mechanisms. Adversarial perturbations are limited to state-space constraints[1, Sec. IV]. |
| **Underspecification** | Fully | Mitigates underspecification through adversarial testing (multiple action types/rooms) and demonstrates robustness via reduced invalid actions across environments. Includes ablation studies showing consistent performance improvements[1, Sec. V]. |

### Key Mechanisms:

- **Frontier Loss**: Enforces margin \$ Q(s,a^-) \leq \min_{a \in \mathcal{V}_s} Q(s,a) - m \$ using structured classification principles[1, Eq. 5].
- **Action Classification**: Predicts valid actions via gradient-masked network trained on interaction history[1, Fig. 2].
- **Safety-Through-Design**: Reduces forbidden action attempts by 50-80% compared to vanilla DQN while maintaining exploration capability[1, Fig. 5,7].
